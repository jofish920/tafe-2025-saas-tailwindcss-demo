Details to come

## First Use

To use this repository, use the following steps:

- Create a local copy
- cd into the folder
- install the packages
- run the dev server

## Create Local Copy & Install Requirements

Open a command line and run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/AdyGCode/tailwindcss-demo-2025-s2
cd tailwindcss-demo-2025-s2 
npm install
```

> **IMPORTANT** You will need Node.JS version 22.18+ or 24.4+ to run vite and other NPM 
> packages.

## Run the Development Server

We are using VITE to run a development server.

Vite is like "make" on Linux and for other systems, and acts as a build application that 
performs actions automatically.

Vite provides:
- dev - used to automatically watch and compile CSS/JS when developing 
- build - used to create production copies of the CSS/JS 

In the same shell execute:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open a browser and go to: http://localhost:5173/

- Localhost is the local computer/host (the one in front of you)
- 5173 is the port that Vite is listening on for requests

- Components are from [HyperUI -https://www.hyperui.dev/](https://www.hyperui.dev/).
